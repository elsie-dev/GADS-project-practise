  DOCUMENTATION MAKES YOU STAND OUT
  
  
  
Having a good documentation not only makes you stand out...It is the entry point to software development.

Joined the 2020 Google Africa Developers Scholarship and has participated in numerous projects on the Cloud Track.
This project basically involve a number of Qwiklabs l have done and some translated labs to commands in the sdk.
l write this commands with Visual Studio text editor,since VS looks and feels more like a plaintext.
